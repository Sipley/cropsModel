# cropsModel

## Motivation

This was completed as part of a project for a special topics graduate course in applying python programming to manipulate and analyze bioinformatics data to solve problems in agriculture and other biological research interests.  

## Description

This is based on code written by Dr. Scott McElroy & can be used to project yearly yield for a crop based on fertilizer and rainfall inputs.

## Usage

To use, simply adjust `fieldInfo` in `def populateSoil()` to your desired specifications in format Soil('soilType', '[phosporus]', '[potassium]'), then run `populateSoil()`.
